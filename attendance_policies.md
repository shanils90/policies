# Attendance Policies Of Cloudlet Technologies

Employees Attendance Policies Of Cloudlet Technologies

### Attendance

Cloudlet Technologies operates with a six-day workweek, allowing one designated day off. All employees, whether on regular or rotational shifts, are expected to work 8 hours each day. The schedule for rotational shifts may vary based on the needs of different functions, departments, or client requirements. Employees are required to be punctual and consistent in their attendance, recording their clock-in and clock-out times using the MyOffice employee portal.

Employees have a grace period of up to 15 minutes before or after their scheduled start time; however, they must ensure that they complete a full 8-hour workday. Accurate attendance is crucial, as failure to record work hours properly will result in Leave Without Pay for the affected days unless the hours are adjusted with the necessary approvals.

If employees anticipate being late or absent, they must inform their supervisor as soon as possible, ideally providing at least 2 hours notice before their shift begins. This notification should include the reason for their absence and an estimated date of return. In rare cases where immediate notification is not possible, employees may have someone else inform their supervisor on their behalf, but they must submit a formal leave application upon their return to work.
