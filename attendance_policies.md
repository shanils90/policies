Employees Attendance Policies

### Attendance

ABC Company operates on a six-day workweek, with the following day designated as a day off. All regular and rotating shift employees are required to work 8 hours each day. The timing of rotational shifts varies according to the needs of different functions, businesses, or clients. Employees are expected to arrive at work regularly and punctually, recording their in-time and out-time on the Myoffice employee portal. While employees may arrive up to 15 minutes before or after the scheduled start time, they must ensure they complete a minimum of 8 hours of work each day. Failure to mark attendance accurately will result in leave without pay (LWP) for the affected days unless the working hours are regularized with the appropriate approvals. Employees should notify their supervisor as soon as possible if they anticipate being late or absent, providing reasons for their absence and an estimated return date. Notifications of absence should be given at least 2 hours before the start of the shift. In exceptional cases, an employee may arrange for someone else to notify their absence, but they must submit a formal leave application upon their return.
