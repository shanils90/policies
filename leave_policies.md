Employees leave policies

## Key Facts

- **CL:** 12
- **SL:** 8

Employees are entitled to 12 casual leave days and 8 sick leave days annually, with a maximum of 3 casual leave days and 2 sick leave days allowed per quarter. Leave balances will carry over to the following quarter. 

At the end of the financial year (March 31), any remaining casual and sick leave will be carried over to the next financial year. Casual leave must be requested at least 3 days in advance, while sick leave should be reported within 3 days after returning to work. Public holidays will be considered working days for all Software/Systems Engineers. Absences due to strikes or hartals will be classified as Emergency Casual Leave (ECL). If insufficient casual leave is available, Leave Without Pay (LWP) will be applied.
